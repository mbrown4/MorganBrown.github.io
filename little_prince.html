    <p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
    </p>
    p {
        text-decoration: underline;
        /* I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. */
    }

    p {
        text-decoration: underline;
        /* It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. */
    }

    <p> In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
        his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:</p>

    p {
        text-decoration: underline;
        /* "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...” */
    }

    <p>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: </p>
        
    p {
        text-decoration: underline;
        /* "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like a flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep...” */
    }

    <p> And I felt him to be more fragile still</p>

    p {
        text-decoration: underline;
        /* I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind... */
    }
